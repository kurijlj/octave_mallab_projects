# FoV Elements Subproject

Welcome to the **FoV Elements** subproject! This repository contains a
collection of algorithms and functions that focus on various aspects of working
with Field of View (FoV) manipulation and analysis. The primary objectives of
this subproject are outlined below:

## Objectives

1. **Computational FoV Generation Algorithm:**
   Develop an algorithm to generate a computational Field of View (FoV). This
   FoV will consist of a 2D pixel map with a predefined number of pixels and
   preset pixel values, resembling a checkerboard pattern.

2. **Reposition and Resize ROI Algorithm:**
   Implement a general algorithm to reposition and resize a given Region of
   Interest (ROI) bounding box within a provided FoV.

3. **Binary Mask Calculation Algorithm:**
   Design a general algorithm to calculate a binary mask representing the
   presence of the given ROI within the provided FoV.

4. **Plotting ROI Bounding Box Algorithm:**
   Develop a general algorithm to plot the bounding box of a given ROI over the
   plot of a FoV, providing a visual representation of their spatial
   relationship.

5. **Test Suite Development:**
   Create a comprehensive test suite that covers all the aforementioned
   algorithms. The tests should ensure the correctness and robustness of the
   implemented functions under various scenarios and edge cases.

## Contents

The subproject is structured as follows:

- **`src/`**: This directory contains the source code for the algorithms
mentioned above. Each function is designed to fulfill a specific objective
outlined in the project.

- **`tests/`**: Here, you'll find the test suite that rigorously assesses the
functionality of the algorithms. Each test case aims to validate the correctness
of the functions and their ability to handle different input scenarios.

## Getting Started

To get started with using the FoV Elements subproject, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone [repository_url]
   ```

2. Navigate to the `src/` directory to explore and utilize the algorithms
implemented for FoV manipulation.

3. If you're interested in testing the algorithms, navigate to the `tests/`
directory and run the test suite to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the
functions.
